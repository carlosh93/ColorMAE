     - ```bash
       # Alternatively you can use wget to download the file
       wget https://image-net.org/data/ILSVRC/2012/ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar
       ```
   - ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar (about 138 GB). MD5: 1d675b47d978889d74fa0da5fadfb00e
     - ```bash
       # Alternatively you can use wget to download the file
       wget https://image-net.org/data/ILSVRC/2012/ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar
       ```


### Post-Download

After downloading the dataset, verify the integrity of the files using checksums (MD5) above. Consider setting up appropriate data storage and backup strategies due to the size of the dataset before extracting the files.

### Extract ImageNet1K dataset
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Taken from https://gist.github.com/bonlime/4e0d236cf98cd5b15d977dfa03a63643
# script to fully prepare ImageNet dataset

## 1. Download the data
# get ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar (about 6.3 GB). MD5: 29b22e2961454d5413ddabcf34fc5622
# wget https://image-net.org/data/ILSVRC/2012/ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar
# get ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar (about 138 GB). MD5: 1d675b47d978889d74fa0da5fadfb00e
# wget https://image-net.org/data/ILSVRC/2012/ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar

## 2. Extract the training data:
mkdir train && mv ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar train/ && cd train
tar -xvf ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar && rm -f ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar
find . -name "*.tar" | while read NAME ; do mkdir -p "${NAME%.tar}"; tar -xvf "${NAME}" -C "${NAME%.tar}"; rm -f "${NAME}"; done
cd ..

## 3. Extract the validation data and move images to subfolders:
mkdir val && mv ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar val/ && cd val && tar -xvf ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soumith/imagenetloader.torch/master/valprep.sh | bash


## 4. Delete corrupted image
# there is one png under JPEG name. some readers fail on this image so need to remove it
# this line is commented by default to avoid such unexpected behaviour
# rm train/n04266014/n04266014_10835.JPEG

```

After extracing the files, place the train, val and test (if you downloaded it) folders, in the `data/imagenet` directory inside the root ColorMAE directory. Create it if it doesn't exist.
